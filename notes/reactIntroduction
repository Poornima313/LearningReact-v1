Babel

- takes future looking js to current js
- .babelrc
	- json objects
	- presets: ["react","es2015"] // includes everything we need to do react transformation and including everything we need to do es2015 transformation
	- single quotes are not valid in json
	- --module-bind 'js=babel' ::: anytime you run into a js file just run it through babel
